\usage{
Query_GO_fn(model_org, GO_db, string_terms)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_org}{a string comprising one of: (for human)
'human', 'HS', 'homo sapiens', (for mouse) 'mouse', 'MM', 'mus musculus',
(for fly) drosophila', DM', 'fly'}

\item{GO_db}{GO.db}

\item{string_terms}{any GO Term string}
}
\value{
\strong{`Query_GO_list`}: a list containing the following objects:
\strong{`GO.Terms`}: a character vector of all the GO Terms associated with the organism and string of interest
\strong{`GO.IDs`}: a character vector of all the GO IDs of the GO Terms associated with the organism and string of interest
\strong{`all_unique_genes`}: a character vector of all the gene symbols associated with provided string
\strong{`GO.list`}: a character vector of gene symbols associated with the GO string that is queried
\strong{`GO_df`}: a dataframe housing the GO Term, ID, GO size, and its associated gene symbols
\strong{`aliases`}: a character vector of the gene symbol aliases associated with the provided GO string
}
\description{
\strong{`Query_GO_fn`} is a function that queries the GO.db with a string
term of interest for a given model organism
}
\details{
Queries the GO.db within a species across (potentially) multiple GO Terms to
aggregate all the terms and associated genes that overlap with a provided string.
Designed for exploration of gene symbols' associations with multiple GO Terms.

For example, parsing which genes are associated with multiple MTOR terms (complexes, etc.)
