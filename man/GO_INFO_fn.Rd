\usage{
GO_INFO_fn(list_of_interest, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_interest}{a character vector of the gene symbols of a
list of genes or proteins}

\item{species}{string of the species of the provided character vector}
}
\value{
\strong{`GENE_GO_INFO_df`}: a dataframe containing all the genes from the
provided list and all the gene ontology terms with which each gene/protein
has been associated with, imperically and/or theoretically
\strong{`GO_INFO_by_TERM_df`}: a dataframe containing all the GO information for
each GO term (i.e. how many and which genes are in each term) that is associated
with at least one gene symbol from the provided character vector
\strong{`Unique_GOs`}: a character vector containing all the unique GO terms
associated with at least one gene symbol from the provided character vector
\strong{`Unique_GO_IDs`}: a character vector containing all the unique GO terms'
IDs for the terms associated with at least one gene symbol from the provided
character vector
\strong{`list_of_interest_aliases`}: a character vector of the same-species
aliases associated with any gene symbol from the provided character vector AND
the provided gene symbol character vector
\strong{`aliases`}: a character vector of only the same-species aliases associated
with any gene symbol from the provided character vector
}
\description{
`GO_INFO_fn()` is a function that extracts gene ontology (GO)
information about a list (character vector) of human/mouse/drosophila gene
symbols
}
\details{
Queries the Bioconductor db to extract the GO info for each gene/protein in a
provided character vector

    + \strong{`species`} can be one of 'human', 'HS', 'homo sapiens',
    'mouse', 'Mm', 'mus musculus',
    'drosophila', 'fly', 'fruit fly', 'DM' (all case insensitive)
