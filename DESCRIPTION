Description: Data wrangling and downstream bioinformatics analysis of NGS data
    (gene or protein lists). Gathers and organizes gene symbol aliases,
    orthologs, and species of the five model biological organisms for a given
    list of interest. Facilitates the organization of gene ontology information
    for analysis and annotation. This method's development began during the
    analysis conducted for Larsen et al., (2022) (see URL field in DESCRIPTION
    for URL), persisted through Wright et al., (2023) (see URL field in
    DESCRIPTION for URL), and was also formally used for Wright et al., (2025)
    (will link URL after publication acceptance at Journal of Cell Science).
    Example data used from the eriklarsen4/Itch repository (see URL field in
    DESCRIPTION for URL). This package also wraps part of the tremendous
    orthogene R package (see URL field in DESCRIPTION for URL), hence, the GPL-3
    license.
