* This is a new release.

"NGS", "et", "al", "bioinformatics", "eriklarsen", "orthogene", "orthologs" are
not misspelled, and are included in the WORDLIST file; however, auto-check still
flags them

URLs are valid on web browser, but formatting in text in the DESCRIPTION or URL
fields of the DESCRIPTION file or in the vignettes, continues to be an issue.
The manual advisory conflicts with the auto-check service formatting
suggestions, along with excluding "LICENSE" variants in the LICENSE field of the 
DESCRIPTION file
